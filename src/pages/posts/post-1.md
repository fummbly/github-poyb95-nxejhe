# My First Blog Post

Published on: 2022-1-1

Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Astro! Here, I will share my learning as I build a new website.

## What I've Accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created my Astro project and setup my online accounts.
2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files and placing them in the `/src/pages/` folder.
3. **Making a Blog Post**: This is my first blog post! I now have Astro pages and Markdown Posts!

## What' Next

I will finish the Astro tutorial, and then keep adding more posts. Watch this space for more to come!
